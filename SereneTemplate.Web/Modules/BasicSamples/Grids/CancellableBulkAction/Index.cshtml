    <p>Here we demonstrate how to handle an action that will run on many records and might take a very long time.</p>
    <p>To keep user patient, we show a cancellable progress dialog. Selected records are splitted into small batches of size 5 per service call.
    We also use 10 parallel service requests to make it quick.</p>
    <p>The service used here is a fake one that delays between 100-500 ms and intentionally fails randomly for demonstration purposes.</p>
    <p>Note that these operations are not performed inside a transaction, thus cancelling action will not revert updates on already processed records.</p>
